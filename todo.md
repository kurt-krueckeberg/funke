# TODO

I tried to match the original document as closely as possible. I have
elimniated pagtes and made only long document, but kept the end-of-page
text found on certain pages that is introduce with eight dashes '--------',
and terminated by a blank line.

I should check the attributions of citations that are apparently at the
bottom of some of the pages. They are not part of the end-of-page extra
text, but on the line immediately below them.
