In order to counteract the unchecked growth of the propertyless class in
Lippe, we believe it is absolutely necessary to enact legal provisions
prohibiting all landlords from taking in lodgers if they cannot provide
them with the necessary garden, arable land, and pasture according to local
conditions. We do not consider this to be any more of a restriction of
individual freedom than requiring a homeowner, in the interest of the
common good, to furnish their home in such a way that it does not pose a
fire hazard. Similarly, young people should not be allowed to marry if
there are no guarantees that they will be able to support themselves, but
rather if it is foreseeable that they will immediately fall into poverty.
As in general, we cannot wish for arbitrary and unnecessary obstacles to
marriage in relation to the Lippe lodgers; we must repeat what we have said
before, that the plight of the propertyless working class has become so
dire largely because the establishment of such households was permitted,
even though it was clear in advance that they would not be able to survive,
and as a result of which poverty has increased to such an

extent that even the greatest charity of the well-to-do cannot remedy it.
