On the circumstances of lodgers in the principalities of Lippe-Detmold
and Schaumburg-Lippe†
By Pastor Georg Funke in Menslage near Osnabrück.

                        I.
According to the 1846 census (Journal
of German Statistics 1847, p. 1059), the Principality of Lippe-Detmold has a population of 106,046
inhabitants living in an area of 20⅗ square miles.

† In the preface to my paper: "On the current situation of farm laborers in
the Principality of Osnabrück, with particular reference to the causes of
their decline and with a view to the means of their uplift.  Bielefeld,
1847," I requested information about the situation of the landless rural
population in northwestern Germany, as I intend to provide a more
comprehensive description of the conditions of this class of people living
in great poverty. I have already received such information from some
quarters, for which I would like to express my public gratitude here;
however, information from many areas is still missing. I therefore repeat
my earlier request and note at the same time that such information, for
which I will soon show my gratitude by sending the intended publication,
will be sent to me reliably by book dealers through Messrs. Hahn in Hanover
and Rackhorst in Osnabrück.——The following article has been edited based
on private communications received.

In 1834, the population was 98,428 (97,720), and by 1840 it had risen to
104,462, so that the average increase in population can be assumed to be
0.7 percent. There are an average of 5,148 inhabitants per square mile.
This is a population density that is found in This is a population density
that is found in few German states. Only the Kingdom of Saxony (with 6,760
inhabitants per square mile), the Grand Duchy of Hesse (with 5,578
inhabitants per square mile), the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg (with 5,367
inhabitants per square mile) and the Principality of Reuss-Greiz (with
5,170 inhabitants per square mile) are even more densely populated. Let us
now consider that the Principality of Lippe is by no means entirely fertile
and cultivated, but rather is mountainous and unsuitable for cultivation,
with large forests and some heathland and only small towns, we must
conclude that there must be very peculiar circumstances that enable the
country to feed such a dense population, especially since trade and
factories are not of great importance. These very peculiar circumstances
will become apparent to us when we consider the situation of the so-called
Einlieger, who until recently were considered in this journal (p. 639) as
not having the right to vote in municipal affairs.


1. Origin of the lodgers (Einlieger).

Since the end of the last century, the landless rural population in the
Principality of Lippe has grown to such an extent that, as is the case in
the Principality of Osnabrück, it now exceeds the number of landowners by a
factor of two on average. As in our region, these landless land dwellers
are called Heuerleute or Heuerlinge, meaning “renters,” i.e., they rent for
one year (heuer = this year), they are called Heuerleute in Lippe
Einlieger, because they live with others, i.e., reside with them. These
Einlieger, who currently make up about two-thirds of the total rural
population, were found in very small numbers in the Principality of Lippe
until the middle of the last century, and in some areas, not at all. Until
then, the younger sons of farm owners who did not have the opportunity to
marry into other farms or move into other circumstances either settled on
uncultivated land in a village or built their own homes in the common lands
belonging to the village, also known as Heiden.  In this way, many small
landowners emerged, and even, as the common lands were gradually
cultivated, small villages were formed, which were then usually named after
the villages or estates from which the colonization originated (Hölser,
Herser, Wülferheide, etc.). In general, there is a tendency in Lippe to
live together in villages rather than in farming communities, as is more
the case in Westphalia proper, where the farms are more or less separated
from each other. Meanwhile, the Lippe villages are not as closed as those
found where the Engern and Eastphalian ways, in contrast to the Westphalian
way, are very clearly evident.

The small landowners who emerged later, new builders, new residents, or, as
they are called in the vernacular, Hoppenplöcker, owned virtually no land
before the division of the common land, with a few exceptions, apart from
some garden land, which was probably allocated to them as soon as they were
given permission to cultivate it.

Initially, they earned their living by working as day laborers on farms,
where they also hired out their children as servants. As their numbers
grew, the work they found in the country was no longer sufficient to
support them, so they sought work abroad and, like their neighbors in
Westphalia proper, turned to Holland, West Friesland, Groningen, and the
neighboring areas. It is well known that in those days, when trade was
significant in the United Netherlands, manual labor brought rich profits
here due to a shortage of workers.  As soon as the sons had grown up, they
followed their fathers. This temporary emigration of the working population
during the summer created a shortage of workers in their homeland,
especially during the season when extra help was most needed on the farms.
As was the case here in Osnabrück, farm owners complained about this in
many ways and also approached the state governments to put restrictions on
this temporary emigration.  Möser says in this regard that the landowners
believed that the state existed for their sake. No wonder, then, that they
believed that the state should provide them with workers by prohibiting
them from going to Holland for low wages .  Incidentally, as in Osnabrück,
the state government in Lippe did not reject the complaints lodged for this
reason, but recognized them as justified.  With regard to Lippe, we do not
know of any specific regulations, but we have been informed that such
regulations were enacted, without success, however.  The situation here
will not have been any different from that in our former bishopric. As
early as 1608, Bishop Philipp Sigismund spoke out against the estates,
saying that complaints had been received about the servants and laborers,
that no one wanted to serve, which caused embarrassment to the hereditary
farmers and citizens, and that, on the contrary, the unmarried people were
leaving for Friesland and other places outside the the diocese, where they
could earn more in a shorter time, and then return at their leisure; that,
furthermore, the wages paid to the laborers were excessive, etc., which is
why it should be carefully considered whether police regulations should be
enacted for such cases. Although we are of the opinion that in earlier
times there were still many sources of income to be found in the country
itself, it was in any case wrong to restrict income abroad by means of
police measures for the sake of ensuring that the locals could obtain cheap
day laborers and servants.  It was only natural that these measures were
fruitless.

The consequence of this temporary emigration was the emergence of the
so-called Einlieger (lodgers) in Lippe. In order to attract workers, the
farm owners gradually began to take married couples into their homes on a
rental basis (to let them live with them) as the population grew, on the
condition that, if required, they would work for a certain daily wage.
Initially, there were no special dwellings for the lodgers.  The vacant
farm buildings were used at first.  Later, however, special houses had to
be built, which were usually furnished for two families. They can now be
found on almost all farms. The following example illustrates the extent to
which this landless population of lodgers has increased in Lippe in recent
times.  A farm owner told me that in 1772, when his grandfather married
into the farm he now owns, there were only 5-6 lodgers in the village;
1846, however, when he compiled the list of lodgers, their number had risen
to 110; the number of landowners, on the other hand, was relatively small,
with only 10 larger colonists among the 39 who kept four or more horses,
and 10 others, each of whom plowed 20–60 (Lippe)

scheffels of seed, some of them with cows; the rest were small owners
(Hoppenplöcker), who owned no land other than the common land that had
fallen to them or even just their small gardens; in addition, there was
also a noble estate there. The increase in the number of tenant farmers
must be regarded as a consequence of the division of common land that took
place throughout the region.  The tenant farmers drove their cattle onto
the common pastures without further ado, so that these, especially since
the Lippe region as a whole has little pasture land, were overgrazed by
cattle and yielded little as pasture. It was not without reason that the
small landowners complained that the larger landowners, with their own
cattle and that of their lodgers, were using the common land
disproportionately. These constant complaints led to the common land being
divided up almost everywhere in order to put an end to this. Given the
dense population of the country and the low yield that the common lands
generally produced in this sparsely irrigated area, the division may have
been expedient insofar as it gained new terrain for cultivation, even if it
did not improve the situation of the tenants.  We are not in favour of the
unconditional We are not in favor of the unconditional division of common
land, as was mostly the case in the Principality of Osnabrück, without
there being any need for it, but rather believe that a limited division,
appropriate to the increased population, would have brought greater
advantages; however, we readily acknowledge that in Lippe, where such large
commons as exist here did not exist at all, the conditions were
significantly different. Since the terrain in Lippe is not very suitable
for grazing, the divided commons, if cultivated, will certainly yield on
average twice as much as was previously the case. Of course, there will
still be some areas that are either completely unsuitable for cultivation
or only yield a harvest if existing production forces can be introduced to
stimulate new ones.


2. The sources of income of the lodgers.

The manual laboring classes in the Principality of Lippe, which include not
only the lodgers but also the small landowners who live in the same
circumstances, earn their livelihood primarily from the linen industry and
then from bricklaying abroad.

a. In the aforementioned paper “On the situation of day laborers, etc.,” we
have commented on the decline of the linen industry in general.  What we
reported also applies to the Lippe region; at present, even a manual
laboring family working diligently in the domestic industry of flax or hemp
can no longer earn a living diligence, can no longer earn a living solely
from the domestic industry of flax or hemp due to the spread of machine
spinning and weaving. Spinning and weaving can currently only be regarded
as secondary work. Overall, however, the linen industry in Lippe was
already less significant than in Ravensberg, Minden, Osnabrück, etc., which
is why the decline of the German linen trade did not have such drastic
negative consequences as in the areas mentioned, where the landless
population was often entirely dependent on spinning and weaving for their
livelihood, and where, with changing circumstances, no replacement for this
cottage industry work to replace this domestic industry, and it is unlikely
that such work will be found in the future. As is well known, England has
excluded us from the linen trade almost everywhere, so that ultimately only
Cuba remains for the sale of our products, where it has already made
inroads. With the ever-expanding cotton production in America, it has also

Seite 1108

come to pass that even in the West Indies, cotton fabrics have partially
displaced linen ones. Incidentally, this can only ever be the case to a
certain degree, as there is no more suitable clothing for tropical
countries than the very durable and cooling linen.  Therefore, it is to be
expected that, despite the machines for the domestic linen industry, a more
favorable time will come once the political conditions in tropical America
have become more stable and if we do not fail to establish favorable direct
trade relations with it.  On the one hand, hand-spun linen, with its
greater strength and durability and other advantages, will hold its own
alongside machine-made linen, and then the industry of the landless
population will turn to more careful processing of flax for the machines.
