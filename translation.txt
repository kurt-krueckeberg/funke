On the circumstances of lodgers in the principalities of Lippe-Detmold
and Schaumburg-Lippe†
By Pastor Georg Funke in Menslage near Osnabrück.

                        I.
According to the 1846 census (Journal
of German Statistics 1847, p. 1059), the Principality of Lippe-Detmold has a population of 106,046
inhabitants living in an area of 20⅗ square miles.

† In the preface to my paper: "On the current situation of farm laborers in
the Principality of Osnabrück, with particular reference to the causes of
their decline and with a view to the means of their uplift.  Bielefeld,
1847," I requested information about the situation of the landless rural
population in northwestern Germany, as I intend to provide a more
comprehensive description of the conditions of this class of people living
in great poverty. I have already received such information from some
quarters, for which I would like to express my public gratitude here;
however, information from many areas is still missing. I therefore repeat
my earlier request and note at the same time that such information, for
which I will soon show my gratitude by sending the intended publication,
will be sent to me reliably by book dealers through Messrs. Hahn in Hanover
and Rackhorst in Osnabrück.——The following article has been edited based
on private communications received.

In 1834, the population was 98,428 (97,720), and by 1840 it had risen to
104,462, so that the average increase in population can be assumed to be
0.7 percent. There are an average of 5,148 inhabitants per square mile.
This is a population density that is found in This is a population density
that is found in few German states. Only the Kingdom of Saxony (with 6,760
inhabitants per square mile), the Grand Duchy of Hesse (with 5,578
inhabitants per square mile), the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg (with 5,367
inhabitants per square mile) and the Principality of Reuss-Greiz (with
5,170 inhabitants per square mile) are even more densely populated. Let us
now consider that the Principality of Lippe is by no means entirely fertile
and cultivated, but rather is mountainous and unsuitable for cultivation,
with large forests and some heathland and only small towns, we must
conclude that there must be very peculiar circumstances that enable the
country to feed such a dense population, especially since trade and
factories are not of great importance. These very peculiar circumstances
will become apparent to us when we consider the situation of the so-called
Einlieger, who until recently were considered in this journal (p. 639) as
not having the right to vote in municipal affairs.


1. Origin of the lodgers (Einlieger).

Since the end of the last century, the landless rural population in the
Principality of Lippe has grown to such an extent that, as is the case in
the Principality of Osnabrück, it now exceeds the number of landowners by a
factor of two on average. As in our region, these landless land dwellers
are called Heuerleute or Heuerlinge, meaning “renters,” i.e., they rent for
one year (heuer = this year), they are called Heuerleute in Lippe
Einlieger, because they live with others, i.e., reside with them. These
Einlieger, who currently make up about two-thirds of the total rural
population, were found in very small numbers in the Principality of Lippe
until the middle of the last century, and in some areas, not at all. Until
then, the younger sons of farm owners who did not have the opportunity to
marry into other farms or move into other circumstances either settled on
uncultivated land in a village or built their own homes in the common lands
belonging to the village, also known as Heiden.  In this way, many small
landowners emerged, and even, as the common lands were gradually
cultivated, small villages were formed, which were then usually named after
the villages or estates from which the colonization originated (Hölser,
Herser, Wülferheide, etc.). In general, there is a tendency in Lippe to
live together in villages rather than in farming communities, as is more
the case in Westphalia proper, where the farms are more or less separated
from each other. Meanwhile, the Lippe villages are not as closed as those
found where the Engern and Eastphalian ways, in contrast to the Westphalian
way, are very clearly evident.

The small landowners who emerged later, new builders, new residents, or, as
they are called in the vernacular, Hoppenplöcker, owned virtually no land
before the division of the common land, with a few exceptions, apart from
some garden land, which was probably allocated to them as soon as they were
given permission to cultivate it.

Initially, they earned their living by working as day laborers on farms,
where they also hired out their children as servants. As their numbers
grew, the work they found in the country was no longer sufficient to
support them, so they sought work abroad and, like their neighbors in
Westphalia proper, turned to Holland, West Friesland, Groningen, and the
neighboring areas. It is well known that in those days, when trade was
significant in the United Netherlands, manual labor brought rich profits
here due to a shortage of workers.  As soon as the sons had grown up, they
followed their fathers. This temporary emigration of the working population
during the summer created a shortage of workers in their homeland,
especially during the season when extra help was most needed on the farms.
As was the case here in Osnabrück, farm owners complained about this in
many ways and also approached the state governments to put restrictions on
this temporary emigration.  Möser says in this regard that the landowners
believed that the state existed for their sake. No wonder, then, that they
believed that the state should provide them with workers by prohibiting
them from going to Holland for low wages .  Incidentally, as in Osnabrück,
the state government in Lippe did not reject the complaints lodged for this
reason, but recognized them as justified.  With regard to Lippe, we do not
know of any specific regulations, but we have been informed that such
regulations were enacted, without success, however.  The situation here
will not have been any different from that in our former bishopric. As
early as 1608, Bishop Philipp Sigismund spoke out against the estates,
saying that complaints had been received about the servants and laborers,
that no one wanted to serve, which caused embarrassment to the hereditary
farmers and citizens, and that, on the contrary, the unmarried people were
leaving for Friesland and other places outside the the diocese, where they
could earn more in a shorter time, and then return at their leisure; that,
furthermore, the wages paid to the laborers were excessive, etc., which is
why it should be carefully considered whether police regulations should be
enacted for such cases. Although we are of the opinion that in earlier
times there were still many sources of income to be found in the country
itself, it was in any case wrong to restrict income abroad by means of
police measures for the sake of ensuring that the locals could obtain cheap
day laborers and servants.  It was only natural that these measures were
fruitless.

The consequence of this temporary emigration was the emergence of the
so-called Einlieger (lodgers) in Lippe. In order to attract workers, the
farm owners gradually began to take married couples into their homes on a
rental basis (to let them live with them) as the population grew, on the
condition that, if required, they would work for a certain daily wage.
Initially, there were no special dwellings for the lodgers.  The vacant
farm buildings were used at first.  Later, however, special houses had to
be built, which were usually furnished for two families. They can now be
found on almost all farms. The following example illustrates the extent to
which this landless population of lodgers has increased in Lippe in recent
times.  A farm owner told me that in 1772, when his grandfather married
into the farm he now owns, there were only 5-6 lodgers in the village;
1846, however, when he compiled the list of lodgers, their number had risen
to 110; the number of landowners, on the other hand, was relatively small,
with only 10 larger colonists among the 39 who kept four or more horses,
and 10 others, each of whom plowed 20–60 (Lippe)

page 1107

scheffels of seed, some of them with cows; the rest were small owners
(Hoppenplöcker), who owned no land other than the common land that had
fallen to them or even just their small gardens; in addition, there was
also a noble estate there. The increase in the number of tenant farmers
must be regarded as a consequence of the division of common land that took
place throughout the region.  The tenant farmers drove their cattle onto
the common pastures without further ado, so that these, especially since
the Lippe region as a whole has little pasture land, were overgrazed by
cattle and yielded little as pasture. It was not without reason that the
small landowners complained that the larger landowners, with their own
cattle and that of their lodgers, were using the common land
disproportionately. These constant complaints led to the common land being
divided up almost everywhere in order to put an end to this. Given the
dense population of the country and the low yield that the common lands
generally produced in this sparsely irrigated area, the division may have
been expedient insofar as it gained new terrain for cultivation, even if it
did not improve the situation of the tenants.  We are not in favour of the
unconditional We are not in favor of the unconditional division of common
land, as was mostly the case in the Principality of Osnabrück, without
there being any need for it, but rather believe that a limited division,
appropriate to the increased population, would have brought greater
advantages; however, we readily acknowledge that in Lippe, where such large
commons as exist here did not exist at all, the conditions were
significantly different. Since the terrain in Lippe is not very suitable
for grazing, the divided commons, if cultivated, will certainly yield on
average twice as much as was previously the case. Of course, there will
still be some areas that are either completely unsuitable for cultivation
or only yield a harvest if existing production forces can be introduced to
stimulate new ones.


2. The sources of income of the lodgers.

The manual laboring classes in the Principality of Lippe, which include not
only the lodgers but also the small landowners who live in the same
circumstances, earn their livelihood primarily from the linen industry and
then from bricklaying abroad.

a. In the aforementioned paper “On the situation of day laborers, etc.,” we
have commented on the decline of the linen industry in general.  What we
reported also applies to the Lippe region; at present, even a manual
laboring family working diligently in the domestic industry of flax or hemp
can no longer earn a living diligence, can no longer earn a living solely
from the domestic industry of flax or hemp due to the spread of machine
spinning and weaving. Spinning and weaving can currently only be regarded
as secondary work. Overall, however, the linen industry in Lippe was
already less significant than in Ravensberg, Minden, Osnabrück, etc., which
is why the decline of the German linen trade did not have such drastic
negative consequences as in the areas mentioned, where the landless
population was often entirely dependent on spinning and weaving for their
livelihood, and where, with changing circumstances, no replacement for this
cottage industry work to replace this domestic industry, and it is unlikely
that such work will be found in the future. As is well known, England has
excluded us from the linen trade almost everywhere, so that ultimately only
Cuba remains for the sale of our products, where it has already made
inroads. With the ever-expanding cotton production in America, it has also

Seite 1108

come to pass that even in the West Indies, cotton fabrics have partially
displaced linen ones. Incidentally, this can only ever be the case to a
certain degree, as there is no more suitable clothing for tropical
countries than the very durable and cooling linen.  Therefore, it is to be
expected that, despite the machines for the domestic linen industry, a more
favorable time will come once the political conditions in tropical America
have become more stable and if we do not fail to establish favorable direct
trade relations with it.  On the one hand, hand-spun linen, with its
greater strength and durability and other advantages, will hold its own
alongside machine-made linen, and then the industry of the landless
population will turn to more careful processing of flax for the machines.


In Lippeschen, according to a farmer, about 20-30 years ago years ago, 12
pieces of so-called commercial yarn were delivered for one thaler;
currently, 15-18 pieces are given for one thaler. It has been claimed that
the difference in earnings cannot be that great, since currently spinning
is done consistently with two hands, which was not the case in the past .
However, it should be noted that although two hands are now used to spin
perhaps 4 pieces of yarn instead of the previous 2 or 2 1/2 pieces, this
yarn is of poorer quality and that 36 pieces had to be delivered for one
thaler. In addition, spinning with two hands naturally requires twice as
much flax. If this is purchased, one receives 7 pounds unpurified for one
thaler, of which approximately 4-5 pounds remain after purification, from
which the spinner can spin only 36 pieces with great difficulty;
consequently, the work would have to be done for nothing if only one thaler
is given for 36 pieces.  Even with higher prices for yarn, the earnings are
so low that a family dependent on spinning cannot survive at all. Usually,
the flax is not purchased, but is grown by the tenants and small landowners
themselves; but then they have to rent the land suitable for flax
cultivation, buy the flax seed, and, at a time when manual labor is well
paid, use it for the preparation of the flax. Of course, there is still a
profit to be made if the flax is grown by oneself, since one's own labor is
valued less highly than it is paid; However, there are also many areas
where it does not thrive particularly well or at all, in which case the
only option is to buy it raw, if one wants to engage in spinning in one's
spare time at all.  It is not uncommon, however, for larger landowners to
grow flax for their tenants on their fields for a cheap price. Similarly,
servants working for larger landowners receive some flax grown on the land.
With regard to the processing of flax, there is still much to be desired;
however, more care has been taken with spinning in recent times.  However,
if spinning is done with two hands, only very ordinary yarn can be
produced.

b. A very peculiar source of income for the Lippe manual laboring class is
bricklaying abroad, or what is known as “going to Holland.” Just as here in
northern Osnabrück, the peat diggers who go to Holstein, Schleswig,
Brandenburg, East and West Prussia, and Posen are called because they first
went to Holstein and Schleswig, so too in Lippe all bricklayers working
abroad are called “Hollandsgänger” or “Friesländer” because they first went
to Holland and Friesland, although a very large proportion of them emigrate
temporarily in the opposite direction.  Lippe residents also go to West
Friesland Lippers also go to West Friesland and Groningen as peat diggers,
and less frequently as manual laborers of other kinds, e.g., as grass
cutters, gardeners, bricklayers, carpenters, glue cooks, etc., as is the
case in the Principality of Osnabrück.

Bricklaying has been practiced since ancient times by the lower classes in
the Principality of Lippe, but for about 25 years it has been transferred
from small landowners to lodgers. As a result of communal divisions, the
latter received plots of land that, although not particularly large, were
often well suited for cultivation, which they now cultivated themselves.
This internal colonization only kept the small landowners in their
homeland, as agriculture, which had previously been a sideline, now became
their main occupation. Since bricklaying has increasingly been taken over
by tenant farmers, it has gained in popularity. It is native to Lippe, and
the skill in it seems to be passed down from one generation to the next,
which is why this work in foreign brickworks can be considered secure for
the future. Overall, it brings in around 400,000 thalers annually to the
country. Even if earnings decline in some areas, the government-employed
courier masters or brick couriers always manage to find new ways to
recover. Two courier masters are employed for Friesland and Holland, where
they conclude contracts and hire workers in Lippe.  In this way, every
brick worker is assured of his earnings; for if the contracts are not
fulfilled, he can seek recourse from the messenger master, who is obliged
to represent him before the authorities.  The messenger masters make their
trips to Friesland (i.e., West Friesland and Groningen) and Holland twice a
year, once to conclude the contracts and then to monitor the fulfillment of
the contracts during the work.

Depending on how favorable the circumstances are, an adult bricklayer earns
between 40 and 60 thalers in pure money during the six months of his
absence.  It is not uncommon for individual masters to bring back over 100,
even 200 thalers. In dry summers, when the clay from which the bricks are
made dries quickly and can therefore be fired more frequently, earnings are
highest.  Of lesser importance is the other manual labor performed by the
Lippe settlers in “Friesland”; it consists mainly of peat digging. The
earnings are lower, but these peat diggers also spend less time away from
home. In about three months, they now earn 15-20, at most 25 thalers; they
leave in April and return towards the end of June or July. However, their
work is harder and unhealthy, as it must be done in wet conditions.†

Footnotes:

† Ref. has often roamed the classic soil of the Principality of Lippe, where
Hermann once defeated Varus and where now, on the summit of the Teutoburg
Forest, stands the unfortunately still unfinished monument to the German
hero.  On one such occasion, he met a lodger who told him that he had once
gone to Friesland as a peat digger. He estimated his earnings at around 20
guilders a year.  He had been working for about a year when he was sent to
the peat bogs near the Rhine.  He had been working for about a year when he
was sent to the peat bogs near the Rhine. On one such occasion, he met a
lodger who told him that he had previously gone to Friesland as a peat
digger. He stated his earnings at around 20 thalers; sometimes he had to
deduct his travel expenses from this, sometimes he had even more. This
worker can serve as an example of how little money is needed to travel from
Lippe to Friesland.  He said that on the outward journey, where he took
some food with him from home, he did not need a full thaler, but on the
return journey, where he did not have any food with him, he did not always
manage with that amount. He said that he had mostly eaten only bread on the
way; only once, in Haselünne, where they always stayed with a butcher, had
they eaten a hot dinner; the meal had been so good that it would not have
been better for a wedding, as they had been served soup with beef and then
sauerkraut with bacon or ham; including the overnight accommodation (on
hay) and the coffee enjoyed the next morning, they paid a total of 7 Mgr.,
which was not too much, but the trip would have been too expensive for them
if they had wanted to spend that much on every overnight stay. —- One can
see what these workers endure on the road.

Despite the fact that foreign bricklaying work brings the lodgers a very
significant income, landowners claim that it has had a negative impact on
the lodgers' living conditions.  Those who are engaged in this work do not
do anything else; they are to be regarded as factory workers who take a
break from their work in winter and cannot be employed elsewhere in the
country.  The young men engaged in this brickwork are also left too much to
their own devices, and in winter they usually spend what they earned in
summer, without thinking about the fact that they need to save for later
years, years, especially the younger ones. Therefore, in the long run,
those who serve the colonists are better off, even though they only receive
20-30 thalers a year in wages. In addition, the more varied economic work,
and in general the intimate connection between agriculture and the
ever-changing nature, does not dull the spirit dull the spirit; rather,
because man does not work alone, but must wait for prosperity to come from
above, the direct emotional connection to God is maintained, which cannot
be said of factory-style brickwork.  The principle of the division of labor
prevails in the latter, on which the relatively high earnings are based;
meanwhile, if man has to do the same thing for six months, he must become
mentally dulled, and it is therefore a quite natural phenomenon that, like
factory workers in general, the so-called Frieslanders also appear to be
morally far more unprincipled than the young men who remain as farmhands on
the farms.

Bricklaying abroad holds a special appeal for the lower classes, so much so
that a few years ago, after the Hamburg fire, where it became most
widespread, all the young men from the tenant farming community emigrated.
The result was that the Lippe farm owners had to recruit most of their
farmhands from neighboring Prussian Westphalia, where bricklaying is not
practiced, and still have to do so. This has also led to an increase in the
number of people without property. The foreign farmhands working in Lippe
form relationships with the girls there and then settle there, unless the
girls remain behind with their children, which only contributes to the
increase in poverty, apart from the further negative consequences in moral
terms, in the event that they marry them.  The landowners generally prefer
to take them in as lodgers in their homes rather than the so-called
Frisians, who know little about rural work and are absent in the summer, so
that no help with work can be expected from them. For this reason, when the
Frisians want to marry, they seek accommodation primarily from small
landowners, because here they do not have to commit to any work and can
therefore continue their periodic emigration.  If such a homeowner has even
a small corner to spare, they try to persuade him to have it converted into
a separate apartment.  As long as such a couple has no or only a few As
long as such a couple has no or only a few children, they can manage with
the cramped dwelling, especially since the man is away for most of the
year; but when several children come along and grow up, the family can
hardly cope, especially in winter, when the grown-up sons, who went abroad
with their father after confirmation, abroad, have returned home with their
father, can hardly bear to live in such a cramped dwelling. Parents and
children, sons and daughters, young and old, all have to sleep in one room,
which must have a detrimental effect not only on their physical health but
also on their morals.  In most cases, these brickworkers are blessed with
many children.  Under such circumstances, the young people cannot be blamed
for seeking to obtain their own apartment as soon as possible, even if it
is worse than that of their parents, in order to marry and start their own
household. In this way, the number of lodgers in Lippe has increased in a
manner that is not commensurate with the size of the country and its
culture, with the result that the country has lost much of its prosperity
as a result of this increase in the propertyless population, since, despite
the significant earnings abroad, the sources of income are still not
sufficient to support the lower classes.  We may call the country
overpopulated, for the number of We may call the country overpopulated, for
the number of propertyless inhabitants has increased abnormally in relation
to the number of property owners, so that the two are out of proportion to
each other.  However, the cause of this overpopulation must be regarded as
foreign brickwork, as can also be seen from our description.


Initially carried out by small landowners who could not find sufficient
sources of income in their homeland, bricklaying work was transferred to
the lodgers after the division of common land, as the former now focused
more on farming. Once the tenants had taken over the brickworks, they
multiplied all the more rapidly, as they now had the opportunity to obtain
housing from the small landowners, which the farm owners could not always
provide if they emigrated temporarily, as they needed such tenants for
their economic work residents who remained in the country. The final
consequence was that, although the country can already be considered
overpopulated, nevertheless, because bricklaying work abroad has become
increasingly widespread, farm owners had to hire foreign laborers, who then
even settled in this overpopulated country. We need hardly add that the
increase in population at present, with 5,148 inhabitants already per
square mile, cannot increase much more, and that the ratio of the
propertied to the propertyless must not become more unfavorable than it
already is if both are to survive at all. Even now, when two-thirds of the
rural population are propertyless, these propertyless inhabitants are an
excessive burden on the property owners, especially in times of misfortune
and in years of hardship, as is now the case, if the population were to
increase at the same rate; as has been the case since 1819, when it stood
at 72,000! There is no other remedy for overpopulation here than
emigration, which is already taking place in many ways; for there is little
or no land left here for internal colonization. We will come back to this
later.
