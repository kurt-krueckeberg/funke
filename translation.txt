On the circumstances of lodgers in the principalities of Lippe-Detmold
and Schaumburg-Lippe†, by Pastor Georg Funke in Menslage near Osnabrück.

                        I.
According to the 1846 census (Journal
for German Statistics 1847, p. 1059), the Principality of Lippe-Detmold has 106,046
inhabitants living in an area of 20⅗ square miles.

† In the preface to my paper: "On the current situation of farm laborers in
the Principality of Osnabrück, with particular reference to the causes of
their decline and with a view to the means of their uplift.  Bielefeld,
1847," I requested information about the situation of the landless rural
population in northwestern Germany, as I intend to provide a more
comprehensive description of the conditions of this class of people living
in great poverty. I have already received such information from some
quarters, for which I would like to express my public gratitude here;
however, information is still lacking from many areas. I therefore repeat
my earlier request and note at the same time that such information, for
which I will soon show my gratitude by sending the intended publication,
will be sent to me reliably by book dealers through Messrs. Hahn in Hanover
and Rackhorst in Osnabrück.  — — The following article has been edited
based on private communications received.

In 1834, the population was 98,428 (97,720), and by 1840 it had risen to
104,462, so that the average increase in population can be assumed to be
0.7 percent. There are an average of 5,148 inhabitants per square mile.
This is a population density that is found in This is a population density
that is found in few German states. Only the Kingdom of Saxony (with 6,760
inhabitants per square mile), the Grand Duchy of Hesse (with 5,578
inhabitants per square mile), the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg (with 5,367
inhabitants per square mile) and the Principality of Reuss-Greiz (with
5,170 inhabitants per square mile) are even more densely populated. Let us
now consider that the Principality of Lippe is by no means entirely fertile
and cultivated, but rather is mountainous and unsuitable for cultivation,
with large forests and some heathland and only small towns, we must
conclude that there must be very peculiar circumstances that enable the
country to feed such a dense population, especially since trade and
factories are not of great importance. These very peculiar circumstances
will become apparent to us when we consider the situation of the so-called
Einlieger, who until recently were considered in this journal (p. 639) as
not having the right to vote in municipal affairs.

1. Origin of the lodgers.

Since the end of the last century, the landless rural population in the
Principality of Lippe has grown to such an extent that, as is the case in
the Principality of Osnabrück, it now exceeds the number of landowners by a
factor of two on average. As in our region, these landless land dwellers
are called Heuerleute or Heuerlinge, meaning “renters,” i.e., they rent for
one year (heuer = this year), they are called Einlieger in Lippe Einlieger,
because they live with others, i.e., reside with them. These Einlieger, who
currently make up about two-thirds of the total rural population, were
found in very small numbers in the Principality of Lippe until the middle
of the last century, and in some areas, not at all. Until then, the younger
sons of farm owners who did not have the opportunity to marry into other
farms or move into other circumstances either settled on a piece of land in
a village that had not yet been cultivated, or they built on the common
land belonging to the village, also known as Heiden.  In this way, many
small landowners emerged, and even, as the common lands were gradually
cultivated, small villages were formed, which were then usually named after
the villages or estates from which the colonization originated (Hölser-,
Herser-, Wülferheide, etc.). In general, there is a tendency in Lippe to
live together in villages rather than in farming communities, as is more
the case in Westphalia proper, where the farms are more or less separated
from each other. Meanwhile, the villages in Lippe are not as closed as
those found where the Engern and Eastphalian ways, in contrast to the
Westphalian way, are very clearly evident.

The small landowners who emerged later, new farmers, new residents or, as
the vernacular calls them, Hoppenplöcker, owned, before the division of the
commons, with few exceptions, except for some garden land, which was
probably allocated to them as soon as they received permission to cultivate
it, virtually no land at all.

Initially, they earned their living by working as day laborers on farms,
where they also hired out their children as servants. As their numbers
grew, the work they found in the country was no longer sufficient to
support them, so they sought work abroad and, like their neighbors in
Westphalia proper, turned to Holland, West Friesland, Groningen, and the
neighboring areas. It is well known that in those days, when trade was
significant in the United Netherlands, manual labor brought rich profits
here due to a shortage of workers.  As soon as the sons had grown up, they
followed their fathers. This temporary emigration of the working population
during the summer created a shortage of workers in their homeland,
especially during the season when extra help was most needed on the farms.
As was the case here in Osnabrück, farm owners complained about this in
many ways and also approached the state governments to put restrictions on
this temporary emigration.  Möser says in this regard that the landowners
believed that the state existed for their sake. No wonder, then, that they
believed that the state should provide them with workers by prohibiting
them from going to Holland for low wages .  Incidentally, as in Osnabrück,
the state government in Lippe did not reject the complaints lodged for this
reason, but recognized them as justified.  With regard to Lippe, we do not
know of any specific regulations, but we have been informed that such
regulations were enacted, without success, however.  The situation here
will not have been any different from that in our former bishopric. As
early as 1608, Bishop Philipp Sigismund spoke out against the estates,
saying that complaints had been received about the servants and laborers,
that no one wanted to serve, which caused embarrassment to the hereditary
farmers and citizens, and that, on the contrary, the unmarried people were
leaving for Friesland and other places outside the the diocese, where they
could earn more in a shorter time, and then return at their leisure; that,
furthermore, the wages paid to the laborers were excessive, etc., which is
why it should be carefully considered whether a police ordinance should be
enacted for such cases. Although we are of the opinion that in earlier
times there were still many sources of income to be found in the country
itself, it was in any case wrong to restrict income abroad by means of
police measures for the sake of ensuring that the locals could obtain cheap
day laborers and servants.  It was only natural that these measures were
fruitless.

Initially, they earned their living as day laborers on farms, where they
also hired out their children as servants. As their numbers grew, the work
they found in the countryside was no longer enough to feed them, so they
sought work abroad and, like their neighbors in Westphalia, turned to
Holland, West Friesland, Groningen, and the neighboring areas. It is well
known that at that time, when trade played an important role in the United
Netherlands, physical labor here yielded high profits due to the labor
shortage.  As soon as the sons came of age, they followed their fathers.
This temporary migration of the working population during the summer led to
a shortage of labor in their homeland, especially during the season when
additional help was most urgently needed on the farms. As here in
Osnabrück, landowners complained about this in many ways and also turned to
the state governments to impose restrictions on this temporary emigration.
Möser says that the landowners believed that the state existed for their
benefit. No wonder, then, that they felt the state should provide them with
labor by prohibiting them from going to Holland for low wages.
Incidentally, the state government in Lippe, as in Osnabrück, did not
reject the complaints submitted for this reason, but recognized them as
justified.  With regard to Lippe, we are not aware of any specific
regulations, but we have been informed that such regulations were enacted,
albeit without success.  The situation here will not have differed from
that in our former diocese. As early as 1608, Bishop Philipp Sigismund
spoke out against the estates and stated that complaints had been received
about the servants and workers, that no one wanted to serve, which caused
embarrassment to the hereditary farmers and citizens, and that, on the
contrary, the unmarried went to Friesland and other places outside the
diocese, where they could earn more in a shorter time, and then return at
will; that, moreover, the wages paid to the workers were excessive, etc.,
which is why it should be carefully examined whether a police ordinance
should be issued for such cases. Although we believe that in the past there
were still many sources of income in the country itself, it was in any case
wrong to restrict income abroad by police measures in order to ensure that
the locals could find cheap day laborers and servants.  It was only natural
that these measures were unsuccessful.

The consequence of this temporary emigration in the Lippe region was the
emergence of the so-called Einlieger. In order to attract workers, as the
population grew, farm owners gradually began to take married couples into
their homes on a rental basis (allowing them to live with them), on the
condition that they would work for a certain daily wage if required.
Initially, there were no special dwellings for the lodgers.  The empty
farmhouses were initially used.  Later, however, special houses had to be
built, which were usually furnished for two The vacant farm buildings were
initially used. Later, however, special houses had to be built, which were
usually furnished for two families. They can now be found on almost all
farms. The following example shows the extent to which this propertyless
population of lodgers has increased in Lippe in recent times.  A farm owner
tells me that in 1772, when his grandfather married into the farm he now
owns A farm owner told me that in 1772, when his grandfather married into
the farm he now owns, there were only 5-6 lodgers in the village; in 1846,
however, when he compiled the list of lodgers, their number had risen to
110; the number of landowners, on the other hand, was relatively small,
with only 10 larger colonists among the 39 who kept four or more horses,
and 10 others, each of whom kept 20–60 (Lippe)

Scheffelsaat is partly cultivated by cows; the rest are small owners
(Hoppenplöcker), who own no land other than the common land that has fallen
to them or even just their small gardens; in addition, there is also a
noble estate there. The increase in the number of tenant farmers must be
regarded as a consequence of the division of common land, which took place
across the board.  The tenant farmers drove their cattle onto the common
pastures without further ado, so that these, especially since the Lippe
region as a whole has little pasture land, were overgrazed by cattle and
yielded little as pasture. It was not without reason that the small
landowners complained that the larger landowners, with their own cattle and
that of their lodgers, were using the common land disproportionately. These
constant complaints led to the common land being divided up almost
everywhere in order to put an end to this. Given the dense population of
the country and the low yield that the common lands generally produced in
this sparsely irrigated area, the division may have been expedient insofar
as it gained new terrain for cultivation, even if it did not improve the
situation of the tenants.  We are not in favor of the unconditional We are
not in favor of the unconditional division of common land, as was mostly
the case in the Principality of Osnabrück, without there being any need for
it, but rather believe that a limited division, appropriate to the
increased population, would have brought greater advantages; however, we
readily acknowledge that in Lippe, where such large commons as exist here
did not exist at all, the conditions were significantly different. Since
the terrain in Lippe is not very suitable for grazing, the divided commons,
if cultivated, will certainly yield on average twice as much as was
previously the case. Of course, some areas will remain that are either
completely unsuitable for cultivation or only yield a harvest if existing
production forces can be introduced to stimulate new ones.

2. The sources of income for the residents.

The manual laboring classes in the Principality of Lippe, which include not
only the residents but also the small landowners who live in the same
circumstances, earn their livelihood primarily from the linen industry and
then from brickwork abroad.

a. In the aforementioned document “On the situation of day laborers, etc.,”
we discussed the decline of the linen industry in general.  What we
reported also applies to the Lippe region; at present, a family engaged in
manual labor, even with all diligence, can no longer earn a living solely
from the domestic industry of flax or hemp due to the spread of machine
spinning and weaving.  Spinning and weaving can currently only be regarded
as secondary work. Overall, however, the linen industry in Lippe was
already less significant than in Ravensberg, Minden, Osnabrück, etc., which
is why the decline of the German linen trade did not have such drastic
negative consequences as in the areas mentioned, where the landless
population was often entirely dependent on spinning and weaving for their
livelihood, and where, with changing circumstances, no replacement for this
cottage industry and is unlikely to find one.  As is well known, England
has excluded us from the linen trade almost everywhere, so that finally
only Cuba remains for the sale of our products, where it has already made
inroads.  With cotton production becoming increasingly widespread in America,

Page 1108

even in the West Indies cotton fabrics have partially replaced linen ones.
Incidentally, this can only ever be the case to a certain extent, as there
is no more suitable clothing for tropical countries than very durable and
very cooling linen.  Therefore, it is to be expected that, despite the
machines for the domestic linen industry, a more favorable time will come
once the political situation in tropical America has stabilized and if we
do not fail to establish favorable direct trade relations with it.  On the
one hand, hand-spun linen, with its greater strength and durability and
other advantages, will hold its own alongside machine-made linen, and then
the industry of the landless population will turn to more careful
processing of flax for the machines.

In Lippe, according to a farmer, 20–30 years ago 12 pieces of so-called
Kaufgarn were delivered for one taler; currently, 15–18 pieces are given
for one taler. It has been claimed that the difference in earnings cannot
be that great, since nowadays spinning is done with two hands throughout,
which was not the case in the past.  However, it should be noted that,
although nowadays two hands may spin 4 pieces of yarn instead of the
previous 2 or 2½ pieces, this yarn is of poorer quality and that as many as
36 pieces had to be delivered for one taler. Of course, spinning with two
hands requires twice as much flax. If this is purchased, one receives 7
pounds unpurified for one taler, of which, once purified, approximately 4–5
pounds remain, from which the spinner can spin only 36 pieces; therefore,
the work would have to be done for nothing if only one taler is given for
36 pieces.  Meanwhile, even with higher prices for yarn, the earnings are
so low that a family dependent on spinning cannot survive at all. Usually,
the flax is not purchased, but is grown by the tenants and small landowners
themselves; but then they have to rent the land suitable for flax
cultivation, buy the flax seeds, and, at a time when manual labor is well
paid, use it for the preparation of the flax.  Of course, there is still a
profit to be made if the flax is grown by the spinner himself, since his
own labor is valued less highly than it is paid ; however, there are also
many areas where it does not thrive particularly well or at all, in which
case the only option is to buy it raw, if one wants to engage in spinning
in one's spare time at all. It is not uncommon, however, for larger
landowners to grow flax for their tenant farmers on their fields for a
cheap price. Similarly, the servants of the larger landowners are given
some flax to grow.  There is still much to be desired in terms of the
processing of flax, but more care has been taken with spinning in recent
times.  However, if two hands are used for spinning, only very ordinary
yarn can be produced.

b. A very peculiar source of income for the Lippe working class is
bricklaying abroad, or what is known as “going to Holland.” Just as here in
northern Osnabrück, the peat diggers who go to Holstein, Schleswig,
Brandenburg, East and West Prussia, and Posen because they first went to
Holstein and Schleswig, so too in Lippe all bricklayers working abroad are
called “Hollandsgänger” or “Friesländer” because they first went to Holland
and Friesland, even though a very large proportion of them emigrate
temporarily in the opposite direction.  Lippe residents also go to West
Friesland Lippers also go to West Friesland and Groningen as peat diggers,
and less frequently as manual

Page 1109

laborers of other kinds, e.g., as grass cutters, gardeners, bricklayers,
carpenters, glue cooks, etc., as is the case in the Principality of
Osnabrück.

Bricklaying has been practiced since ancient times by the lower classes in
the Principality of Lippe, but for about 25 years it has been transferred
from the small landowners to the lodgers. As a result of the division of
common land, the latter received plots that, although not particularly
large, were often well suited for cultivation, which they now cultivated
themselves. This internal colonization only kept the small landowners in
their homeland, as agriculture, which had previously been a sideline, now
became their main occupation. Since bricklaying has increasingly been taken
over by tenant farmers, it has gained in popularity. It is native to the
Lippe region, and the skill in it seems to be passed down from one
generation to the next; therefore, this work in foreign brickworks can be
considered secure for the future. Overall, it brings in around 400,000
thalers annually to the country.  Even if earnings are low in some areas at
times, the messenger masters or brick messengers employed by the government
always know how to find new ways. Two messenger masters are employed for
Friesland and Holland, where they conclude contracts and hire workers in
Lippe. In this way, every brick worker is assured of his earnings, because
if contracts are not fulfilled, he can seek recourse from the messenger
master, who is obliged to represent him before the authorities. The
messenger masters make their trips to Friesland (i.e., West Friesland and
Groningen) and Holland twice a year, once to conclude the contracts and
then to monitor the fulfillment of the contracts during the work.

An adult bricklayer earns, depending on how favorable the circumstances
are, between 40 and 60 Thlr. in cash during the six months of his absence.
Individual masters often bring back more than 100, sometimes even 200 Thlr.
In dry summers, when the clay from which the bricks are made dries quickly
and thus can be fired more frequently, the earnings are highest. Of lesser
importance is the other manual labor performed by the Lippe tenants in
"Friesland"; it mainly consists of peat digging. The earnings are lower,
but these peat diggers are also away from their homes for a shorter time.
In about three months, they now earn 15–20, at most 25 Thlr.; they leave in
April and return by the end of June or July. However, their work is more
laborious and unhealthy, as it must be done in wet conditions.†
