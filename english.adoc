On the Conditions of the Landless Rural Population in the Principalities of Lippe-Detmold and Schaumburg-Lippe
By Pastor Georg Funke in Menslage near Osnabrück

The Principality of Lippe-Detmold, according to the census of 1843,
supports a population of 133,161 inhabitants on an area of approximately 42
square miles (Quadratmeilen). Of this number, 51,220 live in towns, while
81,941 belong to the rural population.

Within this rural population, a very considerable portion consists of
landless rural lodgers (Einlieger), that is, persons who possess neither
house nor landed property of their own and who therefore must seek shelter
either as tenants in the dwellings of others or as lodgers within foreign
households.

Alongside these stand the small tenant laborers (Heuerleute), who usually
occupy a small house together with a garden or a modest plot of land, held
under lease and commonly burdened with labor obligations. Although their
situation is somewhat more secure than that of the landless rural lodgers
(Einlieger), their economic independence remains very limited.

By contrast, the number of fully independent rural householders is
relatively small. Larger and medium-sized farms are concentrated in
comparatively few hands, while the greater part of the rural population is
compelled to earn its livelihood through day labor, agricultural service,
or subsidiary occupations.

From this distribution of property there arises a condition in which a
large segment of the population lacks secure and enduring means of
subsistence. Such households are exposed, to an exceptional degree, to
fluctuations in agricultural demand, to unfavorable harvests, and to
general economic disturbances.

This situation is rendered still more difficult by the scarcity of
industrial and commercial employment opportunities within the principality.
Manufacturing establishments are few, and those that do exist are, for the
most part, incapable of absorbing the surplus rural labor force. As a
result, many landless rural inhabitants (Einlieger) are compelled to seek
employment beyond their native districts, either as itinerant laborers or
through seasonal migration.

Such migration, however, entails serious disadvantages. Family life is
disrupted, continuity of household management is weakened, and customary
forms of social oversight are loosened. In this way, economic insecurity
contributes not only to material hardship but also to broader social
dislocation.

Charitable assistance and pastoral care are indispensable in alleviating
immediate distress. Yet it becomes evident that these measures cannot
remove the underlying causes of the condition described. These causes lie
rather in the unequal distribution of land, the lack of alternative forms
of employment, and the continuous increase of the population.

If attention is now turned from Lippe-Detmold to the neighboring
Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, conditions are encountered that in many
respects resemble those just described, yet which also display noteworthy
differences.

Schaumburg-Lippe comprises a considerably smaller territory, and its
population is correspondingly more limited. Nevertheless, here too a
strikingly large proportion of the inhabitants belongs to the class of
landless rural lodgers (Einlieger). Their number stands in a conspicuous
disproportion to that of the independent landholders.

The origin of this condition is to be sought partly in earlier historical
developments. Former divisions of land, patterns of inheritance, and the
gradual fragmentation of holdings have resulted in ever smaller parcels of
arable land. These parcels are frequently insufficient to sustain a
household, so that numerous descendants are excluded from independent
farming and compelled to seek their livelihood in other ways.

In this manner there has arisen a broad stratum of the population whose
existence depends almost entirely upon day labor, agricultural service, or
subsidiary trades. The dwellings of the landless rural lodgers (Einlieger)
are often cramped and unhealthy, and it is not uncommon for several
families or individuals to be crowded together within a very limited space
or accommodated as lodgers in the houses of others.

The small tenant laborers (Heuerleute) occupy an intermediate position
between these groups. They generally possess a modest dwelling and a small
piece of land, yet their economic situation remains insecure. Their tenure
is usually of short duration, their obligations heavy, and their dependence
upon landowners substantial. Any interruption of employment or rise in the
cost of living is sufficient to place them in immediate distress.

As in Lippe-Detmold, so also in Schaumburg-Lippe the opportunities for
employment outside agriculture are extremely limited. Crafts and small
manufactures exist only to a restricted extent and are unable to absorb the
surplus labor created by population growth. Younger people in particular
find few prospects beyond domestic service, migratory labor, or casual
employment.

The effects of these circumstances are not confined to economic hardship
alone. They also exert an influence upon social order and moral life.
Insecure conditions of livelihood impede the formation of stable
households, delay marriage, and give rise to forms of cohabitation that
depart from established norms. Communities are thereby confronted with
difficulties that cannot be overcome through admonition or benevolence
alone.

Various measures have repeatedly been undertaken by public authorities with
the aim of alleviating these conditions. Regulations, relief provisions,
and occasional reforms have been introduced. Yet it becomes apparent that
such interventions have generally addressed immediate needs rather than the
deeper structural causes. So long as access to land remains restricted and
alternative sources of employment insufficiently developed, the number of
landless rural inhabitants (Einlieger) must necessarily continue to
increase.

A closer consideration of population statistics shows that the growth of
the landless rural population (Einlieger) is not the result of accidental
or isolated circumstances, but follows a clearly recognizable course. Over
recent decades the total population of both principalities has steadily
increased, while the extent of cultivable land has remained essentially
unchanged.

From this situation there necessarily arises an intensification of
competition for both land and employment. Holdings that were formerly
sufficient to support a household and its successors are now either divided
into ever smaller parts or retained undivided by a single heir, while
brothers and sisters are left without the possibility of independent
subsistence. These individuals are thereby added to the class of landless
rural lodgers (Einlieger) or to that of the small tenant laborers
(Heuerleute).

The available statistical evidence further shows that the proportion of
landless inhabitants is particularly high in districts with inferior soil
quality and limited agricultural productivity. In such regions even
established farms yield only modest returns, and opportunities for
supplementary income are especially scarce. The rural poor are thus doubly
disadvantaged, by the lack of property and by unfavorable natural
conditions.

The burden of maintaining this population increasingly falls upon the local
communities. Expenditures for poor relief rise from year to year, while
municipal resources remain narrowly circumscribed. In years of crop failure
or general economic disruption, the demand for assistance grows with
particular rapidity and often exceeds the capacity of local authorities to
provide adequate relief.

At first glance, migration appears to offer a partial remedy. Many landless
rural inhabitants (Einlieger) seek temporary or permanent employment in
other regions, especially where seasonal agricultural labor or construction
work is available. Yet closer examination shows that such migration rarely
leads to lasting improvement. Wages are low, conditions of life insecure,
and family ties weakened or entirely dissolved.

Moreover, outward migration does not remove the underlying cause of the
problem. Those who leave are soon replaced by new entrants into the same
social condition, as population growth continues unabated. In this way the
fundamental imbalance between population and productive resources remains
unresolved.

It thus becomes evident that these developments cannot be adequately
explained by reference to individual shortcomings or personal misconduct.
Rather, they are the necessary outcome of long-term economic and
demographic forces. Without deliberate measures aimed at altering these
conditions, a further deterioration in the situation of the landless rural
population (Einlieger) must be anticipated.

The consequences of these conditions extend far beyond questions of
material livelihood. They exert a deep influence upon the entire social and
moral life of the rural population. Where economic insecurity prevails, the
foundations upon which orderly household formation rests are weakened, and
long-established patterns of family life are disrupted.

For the landless rural lodgers (Einlieger), the establishment of an
independent household through marriage is often impossible at an early age.
Many are compelled to postpone marriage for long periods, while others
enter into unstable domestic arrangements that lack the permanence and
security of a properly founded household. From this arise tensions and
disturbances that are perceived as burdensome by the communities concerned.

Children who grow up under such circumstances are frequently deprived of
the steady guidance that a secure family environment affords. Limited
access to schooling, the irregular employment of parents, and frequent
changes of residence hinder both intellectual development and moral
formation. In this manner the effects of poverty are transmitted from one
generation to the next.

It would be a serious error to ascribe these conditions primarily to a lack
of diligence or to moral deficiency on the part of the individuals
affected. Personal conduct undoubtedly exerts an influence; yet it is
itself shaped and constrained by external circumstances. Where
opportunities for stable work and secure subsistence are lacking, even the
most earnest effort often proves insufficient to achieve lasting
improvement.

Religious instruction and pastoral care are therefore indispensable and of
great value. Nevertheless, it becomes evident that they cannot replace the
material foundations of existence. Moral exhortation alone cannot
compensate for the absence of land, employment, and economic security. To
expect such an effect would be to misunderstand the nature of the problem.

The existing arrangements for poor relief are likewise subject to critical
examination. Although they provide necessary assistance in cases of
immediate need, they often operate in a manner that fosters dependency
rather than self-reliance. Relief that is granted without opening paths
toward sustainable improvement risks perpetuating the very condition it
seeks to alleviate.

From this consideration arises the conclusion that any genuine remedy must
be directed toward the structural causes of rural poverty. Without measures
that broaden access to productive resources or create new opportunities for
gainful employment, the number of landless rural inhabitants (Einlieger)
will continue to increase, together with the burdens thereby imposed upon
the community as a whole.

In considering possible means of improvement, it must first be emphasized
that no simple or rapid solution can be expected. The condition of the
landless rural population (Einlieger) has developed over a long period and
is rooted in circumstances that cannot be altered without sustained and
carefully considered effort.

Proposals for a further subdivision of land are frequently advanced as a
remedy. Such measures may indeed bring temporary relief to individual
families; yet excessive fragmentation of holdings ultimately undermines
agricultural productivity. Parcels that are too small cannot provide a
secure livelihood and may, in the long run, contribute to an
intensification of poverty rather than its alleviation.

Greater promise lies in the deliberate promotion of supplementary sources
of employment. The establishment of rural industries, small manufactories,
and craft enterprises could provide work during periods when agricultural
labor is insufficient. In this way income might be stabilized and the
necessity of seasonal migration reduced, thereby strengthening family life
and social cohesion.

The improvement and extension of education likewise deserves serious
attention. Practical instruction, particularly in skills applicable beyond
agriculture, would increase the capacity of young people to adapt to
changing economic conditions. Such instruction, however, must be oriented
toward realistic opportunities for employment if it is to fulfill its
intended purpose.

Attention is also directed to the possibility of regulated settlement
initiatives. By facilitating access to small parcels of land under secure
and clearly defined conditions of tenure, it might be possible to enable
industrious individuals to establish modest but stable households. Such
measures would require careful supervision in order to prevent misuse and
to ensure that holdings remain economically viable.

In this connection, the comparison between Lippe-Detmold and
Schaumburg-Lippe remains instructive. Differences in administrative
practice and land management have produced variations in outcome, which
indicate that policy decisions are not without significance. Where
foresight and flexibility have guided such decisions, conditions appear
less burdensome, although nowhere entirely satisfactory.

It thus becomes clear that the question of the landless rural population
(Einlieger) is not a matter of marginal importance. It touches upon the
economic strength, the moral health, and the social stability of the
principality as a whole. Neglect of this issue must inevitably entail
serious consequences.

In conclusion, attention is once more directed to the broader significance
of the condition described. A persistent and unchecked growth of the
landless rural population (Einlieger) cannot remain without consequences
for the overall stability of social relations within the principalities.

Where economic insecurity becomes widespread and enduring, it inevitably
manifests itself in heightened social tension, a weakening of communal
bonds, and increasing demands upon public resources. Preventive measures,
therefore, are not to be regarded merely as acts of benevolence, but as
requirements of prudent and responsible governance.

Responsibility in this matter does not rest with public authorities alone.
Landowners, local communities, and all those who participate in the
ordering of rural life share in the obligation to recognize the seriousness
of the situation and to contribute to its improvement. Measures directed
toward structural reform, though often associated with difficulty and
expense, promise greater and more lasting benefit than the continual
expansion of relief provisions that address only immediate need.

At the same time, caution and moderation are urged. Reforms must proceed
from careful observation, sound knowledge of local conditions, and respect
for existing institutions. Sudden or ill-considered interventions risk
producing effects contrary to those intended and may aggravate the
difficulties they seek to remedy.

The landless rural population (Einlieger), it may be concluded, should not
be regarded as a fixed or unavoidable underclass. Given appropriate
conditions—secure opportunities for productive labor, access to sustainable
means of subsistence, and a stable social framework—many among them could
attain a settled and independent mode of life. To create the foundations
for such a development is a task incumbent upon the present generation.
